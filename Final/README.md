For this final project I wrote my own code for the home page as it had the most complex grid changes from layout to layout. For my other two pages I relied on Bootstrap plug in to do most of the heavy lifting and using inline code for css properties bootstrap wasn't able to perfrom.

Upon reaching a certain point in the Bootstrap pages I realized that media qeeries were required, or would be easier to add then figuring things out in bootstrap. It is at this point I created a seperate css doc for both those second pages.

The largest challenges I faced were the creation of the form on the home page, it just did not want to cooperate with me for the longest time. Additionally, I struggled a lot with the banners and text over them, as you'll see on the homepage the box doesn't resize as intended, I struglled a lot with that. Finally, the scrolling view on the gallery was really tricky to code.

I learnt a lot more refinement with bootstrap and plan to use it in many more projects as it make life a lot better.

Over all I'm happy with the end product as I poured a lot of effort in fixing my issues, however I am aware of it's inperfections.
